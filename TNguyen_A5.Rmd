Use the `continent.csv` dataset to produce the following graph. Write a few sentences to describe the main features of your graph.

This graph displays the number of people from each continent who applied for immigrant visas in 2020. Africa has the highest number of applicants with 55 people, representing 26.6% of the total, followed by Asia (23.7%) and Europe (23.2%). North America, Oceania, and South America have significantly fewer applicants, with North America contributing 12.6%, Oceania 7.7%, and South America 6.3%. The percentages are displayed inside the bars, while the X-axis represents the number of people. The graph is clear, with colored bars representing each continent and no legend, as the colors are self-explanatory.
